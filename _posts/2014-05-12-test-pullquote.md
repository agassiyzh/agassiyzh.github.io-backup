<p class="has-pullquote pullquote-adelle" data-pullquote="A pull quote is a purely visual technique, and therefore should not change the structure of the body.">Blatantly copying the excerpt of the pull quote into itâ€™s own element is not the way to go. A pull quote is a purely visual technique, and therefore should not change the structure of the body. Next to that, a structural representation of the excerpt would be seen twice by people using feed readers or services like <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, as well as be re-read for people who use screen readers. So how can we best author this into our mark-up?</p>
